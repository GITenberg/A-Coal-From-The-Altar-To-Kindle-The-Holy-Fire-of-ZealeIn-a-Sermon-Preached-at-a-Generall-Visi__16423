<h3>To my reverend Friend Mr.<br/>
SAMUEL WARD.</h3>

<p><i>Sir, your Sermon which I copied partly
from your mouth, and partly from your
notes, I have adventured into the light;
encouraged by the approbation, and earnest
entreaty of such, whose judgements you
reverence, and whose love you embrace:
who also have made bolde heere and there
to varie some things, not of any great consequence,
if I can judge. I was loth to
smoother such fire in my brest; but to vent
it, to enflame others. If you shall blame me,
I know others will thanke mee. What I
have done, is out of Zeale to God and his
Church.</i></p>

<p align="right">Your affectionate friend,</p>

<p align="right"><i>Ambrose Wood.</i></p>

<div class="sidenote_l">1</div>
<div class="sidenote_r">Mat. 24. 12.</div>
<div class="sidenote_r">1 Kin. 1. 1.</div>

<p>This watch-word of Christ,
if it be not now a word in
season, I know not when
ever it was, or will bee:
Would he now vouchsafe
to bestow a letter upon his Church
heere on earth; should hee need to alter
the tenour of this? which being the last,
to the last of the seaven Churches, why
may it not (saith an Ancient, upon this
text) typifie the estate of the last Age
of his Churches? the coldnesse whereof
himselfe hath expressely foretolde.
And if God should now send through
he earth such surveying Angels as <i>Zacharie</i>
mentions, chapter 1. Could they
returne any other observation of their
travailes then theirs; <i>The whole world
lies in lukewarmnesse?</i> which makes mee
often in my thoughts proportion these
ends of time, to the like period of <i>Davids</i>
age, when no cloathes were enough
to keepe heare in him. <i>Faith</i> I grant
is a more radicall, vitall, and necessary
grace; but yet not so wholly out of
<i>grace</i> with the times, as poore <i>Zeale</i>;
which yet if by any meanes it might
once againe be reduced into favour and
practice, before Time sets, and bee no
more; I doubt not but Christ would
also yet once againe in this evening of
the world, come and <i>Sup</i> with us; A
favour including all other in it.</p>

<div class="sidenote_l">2</div>

<p>My desire especially is, that this our
Iland might take it to it selfe, as well as
if it had by name beene directed to it;
what would it hurt us to make an especiall
benefit and use of it? Some of
our owne, have so applyed it; (whether
out of their judgements, or affections,
I say not.) Learned <i>Fulk</i> marvels if
it were not by a Propheticall spirit penned
for us: others more resolutely have
made it a singular type of purpose for
us. Their warrant I know not; especially
if it bee true which all travellers tell
you, <i>That they finde more zeale at home
then abroad.</i> We are I grant in sundry respects
equall to <i>Laodicea</i>: Even the very
names thereof, as well the first and oldest
in regard of the blessings of God,
<span class="greek" title="[Greek: Dios polis]">
&#916;&#953;&#959;&#962; &#960;&#959;&#955;&#953;&#962;</span>
Gods Darling, as the later in
regard of good Lawes and Civility, <i>Laodicea</i>,
How well doe they become us?
As rich as they, and that in the very same
commodity of woolls; <i>Abounding as
they</i> with many learned <i>Zenoes</i> &amp; bountifull
<i>Hieroes</i>; <i>Parallel</i> in all regards; I
would I could say lukewarmnesse excepted.
But I must bee a faithfull and
true witnesse, and yet this is all I have
to say; It was, as I conceive, <i>Laodicea's</i>
complexion and not her constitution,
her practice not her orders, personall
lukewarmnesse not legall, which
Christ strikes at. That fault I finde in my
text, the same I finde in our common
Christians, whose spirituall condition,
and state is too like the externall situation
of our Country, between the Torrid,
and the Frigid Zones; neither hot nor
colde: and so like <i>Laodicea</i>, that if wee
take not warning, or warming, we may,
I feare, in time come to be spued out of
Gods mouth.</p>

<div class="sidenote_l">3</div>

<p>For this present assembly of Ministers,
could all the choice and time in the
world have better fitted mee then mine
ordinarie Lot? If fire bee set upon the
Beacons, will not the whole Countrey
soone be warned and enlightned?</p>

<div class="sidenote_l">4</div>

<p>For my selfe also, mee thinkes it will
better beseeme my yeeres to heat, then
to teach my Ancients; to enkindle
their affections, then to enforme their
judgements. And whereas <i>Paul</i> bids
<i>Titus</i> preach zeale with all authoritie;
though in mine owne name I crave
your patience, and audience, yet in his
name that is the first of the creatures,
and <i>Amen</i>, I counsell him that hath an
eare, to heare what the Spirit saith to the
Churches;</p>

&#918;&#951;&#955;&#969;&#963;&#959;&#957;
</span>, <i>Be Zealous.</i></p>

<p>Zeale hath been little
practized, lesse
studied: this heavenly
fire hath ever
beene a stranger
upon earth.
Few in all ages
that have felt the
heat of it, fewer that have knowne the
nature of it. A description will rake it
out of the embers of obscurity: and it
may be that many when they shall know
it better, will better affect it.</p>

<p>2. Zeale hath many counterfets and
allies. There are many strange fires
which having sought to carry away the
credit of it, have brought in an ill name
upon it: from these it would bee distinguished.</p>

<p>3. Zeale is every where spoken against
it hath many enemies and few friends:
the world can no more abide it, then
beasts can the elementary fire, the rebukes
of many have falne upon it, the
Divell weaves cunning lies to bring
downe the honour of it. Oh that wee
could raise and maintaine it, by setting
forth the deserved praise of it; and challenge
it from the false imputations of
such as hate it without a cause.</p>

<p>4. Zeale hath in this our earthly
molde, little fuell, much quench-coale,
is hardly fired, soone cooled. A good
Christian therefore would bee glad to
know the Incentives and preservatives
of it, which might enkindle it, enflame
it, feed it, and revive it when it is going
out.</p>

<p>5. Zeale in the worlds opinion, is as
common as fire on every mans hearth,
no mans heart without zeale, if every
man might be his owne judge; If most
might be heard there is too much of it;
but the contrary will appear if the right
markes bee taken, and the true rules of
triall and conviction bee observed, and
the heart thereby examined.</p>

<p>6. Zeale generally handled will break
as lightning in the aire, and seize upon
no subject: Application must set it on
mens harts, and exhortation warme this
old and colde age of the world, chiefly
this temperate climate of our nation.</p>
<br />

<p><i>First Part</i>.</p>

<p>It was sayd of olde, that zeale was an
<i>Intension of love</i>: of late, that it is a compound
of <i>love and anger, or indignation</i>.</p>

<p>The Ancients aimed right, and shot
neere, if not somwhat with the shortest.
The moderne well discovered the use
and exercise of more affections, then
love, within the fathome and compasse
of zeale; but in helping that default,
went themselves somewhat wide, and
came not close to the marke: which I
ascribe not to any defect of eye-sight in
those sharpe sighted Eagles; but onely
to the want of fixed contemplation.
And to speake truth, I have oft wondered why
poore <i>Zeale</i>, a vertue so high
in Gods books, could never be so much
beholding to mens writings as to obtain
a just treatise, which hath beene the lot
of many particular vertues of inferiour
worth; a plaine signe of too much under-value
and neglect.</p>

<p>Hee that shall stedfastly view it, shall
finde it not to bee a degree or intension
of love, or any single affection (as the
<i>Schooles</i> rather confined then defined
zeale) neither yet any mixt affection (as
the later, rather compounded then
comprehended the nature of it) but an
<i>hot temper, higher degree or intension of
them all</i>. As varnish is no one color, but
that which gives glosse &amp; lustre to all; So
the opposites of zeale, key-coldnes and
lukewarmnesse, which by the Law of
contraries must bee of the same nature,
are no affections, but severall tempers of
them all.</p>

<div class="sidenote_r">Acts 26. 7.</div>

<p><i>Paul</i> warrants this description where
hee speakes of the twelve Tribes. <i>They
served God with intension or vehemency</i>.</p>

<p>The roote shewes the nature of the
branch. Zeale comes of <span class="greek" title="[Greek: z&ocirc;]"> &#918;&#969;</span>, a word framed
of the very sound and hissing noise,
which hot coales or burning iron make
when they meete with their contrary.
In plaine English, zeale is nothing but
heate: from whence it is, that zealous
men are oft in Scripture sayd to burne in
the spirit. <span class="greek" title="[Greek: zeontes pneumati]">
&#950;&#949;&#959;&#957;&#964;&#949;&#962; &#960;&#957;&#949;&#965;&#956;&#945;&#964;&#953;</span>.</p>

<p>Hee that doth moderately or remisly
affect any thing, may be stiled <i>Philemon</i>,
a lover; he that earnestly or extreamely,
<i>Zelotes</i>, a zelot; who to all the objects of
his affections, is excessively and passionately
disposed, his love is ever fervent,
his desires eager, his delights ravishing,
his hopes longing, his hatred deadly,
his anger fierce, his greefe deep, his feare
terrible. The Hebrewes expresse these
Intensions by doubling the word.
This being the nature of zeale in generall,
Christian zeale of which wee desire
onely to speake, differs from carnall
and worldly, chiefly in the causes and
objects.</p>

<p>It is a spirituall heate wrought in the
heart of man by the holy Ghost, improoving
the good affections of love,
joy, hope, &amp;c. for the best service and
furtherance of Gods glory, with all the
appurtenances thereof, his word, his
house, his Saints and salvation of soules:
using the contrarie of hatred, anger,
greefe, &amp;c as so many mastives to flie
upon the throat of Gods enemies, the
Divell, his Angels, sinne, the world with
the lusts thereof. By the vertue wherof
a <i>Zealot</i> may runne through all his affections,
and with <i>David</i>, breath zeale
out of every pipe, after this manner for
a taste;</p>

<div class="sidenote_l">Psalme Love.</div>

<p><i>How doe I love thy Law (O Lord) more
then the hony or the hony-combe, more then
thousands of silver and gold!</i></p>

<div class="sidenote_l">Hatred.</div>

<p><i>Thine enemies I hate with a perfect
hatred.</i></p>

<div class="sidenote_l">Joy.</div>

<p><i>Thy testimonies are my delight: I rejoyce
more in them, then they that finde great
spoyles, more then in my appoynted food.</i></p>

<div class="sidenote_l">Grief.</div>

<p><i>Mine eyes gush out rivers of teares. Oh
that my head were a fountain of teares, because
they destroy thy Law.</i></p>

<div class="sidenote_l">Hope.</div>

<p><i>Mine eyes are dimme with wayting: how
doe I long for thy salvation?</i></p>

<div class="sidenote_l">Feare.</div>

<p><i>Thy judgements are terrible, I tremble
and quake, etc.</i></p>

<p>Look what pitch of affection the naturall
man bestowes upon his dearest darling,
what unsatiable thirst the covetous
worldling upon his Mammon, the ambitious
upon his honour, the voluptuous
upon his pleasure; the same the
Christian striveth in equall, yea, (if
possible) farre exceeding tearmes to
convert and conferre upon God and his
worship.</p>

<p>In briefe, to open a little crevise of
further light, and to give a little glimpse
of heat: Zeale is to the soule, that which
the spirits are to the bodie; wine to the
spirits, putting vigour and agility into
them. Whence comes that elegant Antithesis
in the Scripture. <i>Bee not drunke
with wine wherein is excesse, but be filled
with the Spirit.</i></p>

<div class="sidenote_r">Ser. 41. in Can. 49.</div>

<div class="sidenote_r">Acts 2.</div>

<p>Christ is sayd to lead his Spouse into
the wine-cellar: which Simily <i>Bernard</i>
delighting oft to repeat, in two or
three Sermons interprets of a speciall
measure of zeale inspired into his
Church. Thus (saith hee) Christ led his
Disciples into the wine cellar on the day
of Pentecost; and filled them, and the
house with such zeale as they came forth
like Giants refreshed with wine, and seemed
to the people as men drunke with
new wine.</p>

<div class="sidenote_r">Heb. 1. 7.</div>

<p>It is to the soule, as wings to the foule:
this also is a Scripture embleme to picture
the Angels with wings, as in the
hangings of the Temple, and in the visions
of the revelation, in token of their
ardent and zealous execution of Gods
will: whence also they have their name
<i>Seraphim</i>; hee maketh his ministers a
flame of fire.</p>

<p>To this fire and these wings, which
we in the Lords prayer desire to imitate,
there is nothing in us answerable but
our zeale; as wheeles to the charriot:
which makes us not goe, but runne the
wayes of Gods Commandements, and
so runne that we may obtaine. As sailes
to the ship, and winde to the sailes, to
which alludes the phrase so frequent in
Scripture, <i>Plerophorie</i>.</p>

<p>As courage to the souldier, mettle to
the horse, dust to the ground, which
makes it bring forth much fruit, yea an
hundredfold: vivacity to all creatures.
To conclude this, this is that celestiall
fire which was shadowed out unto us
by that poore element in comparison,
and beggarly rudiment, the fire (I
meane) of such necessary use in the law,
which rather then it should be wanting,
the Lord caused it to descend from heaven,
that it might cause the Sacrifices
to ascend thither againe, as a sweet incense
unto the Lord, without which no
burnt offering was acceptable.</p>
<br />

<p><i>The Second Part.</i></p>

<p>But now, as then, there are certaine
false fires, abhominable to God, odious
to men, dangerous to the <i>Nadabs</i> and
<i>Abihues</i> that meddle with them, bringing
thereby coales upon their owne
heads, &amp; ill favor upon all their services;
&amp; not onely so, but that which is worse,
an ill report and surmize even on those
that offer the right fire, &amp; serve the Lord
in spirit and truth: yet for their sakes is
the name of zeale blasphemed all the
day long.</p>

<p>Against these, as then, so now severe
caveats and cleere distinctions must bee
laid, lest such as have not their senses exercised
to put a difference, mistake poysonfull
weedes for wholesome hearbes,
to their owne destruction; and for the
sake of the one, revile the other to the
wrong of God and his Saints.</p>

<p>It fares not otherwise with the soule
then with the body: besides the native &amp;
radicall heat, the principall instrument
of life, there are aguish and distempered
heats, the causes of sicknesse and death.</p>

<p>To discerne of those, requires some
skill and judgement: yet a good Empirick,
a Christian of experience will give
a shrewd ghesse at them, the easier &amp; the
better if he marke these following signes
and symptomes, common to all the
kinds of false zeale, here also following.</p>

<div class="sidenote_l">1. Ostentation.</div>

<p>First, they are deeply sicke of the pharisaicall
humor, they love to be seene of
men, and say with <i>Jehu, Come and see how
zealous I am for the Lord of hosts</i>: they
proclaime their almes with a trumpet,
paint their good deedes upon Church
windowes, engrave their legacies upon
tombes, have their acts upon record:
Thus, Comets blaze more then fixed
Starres. Aguish heats breede flushings,
&amp; are more seen in the face, then natural
warmth at the heart. Schollers count hiding
of Art the best Art: the godly man
studies by all meanes how to conceale
the one hand from the other, in doing
well; hiding of zeale is the best zeale.</p>

<p>Secondly, of <i>Ahabs</i> disease exceeding
in externall humiliation, affected
gestures, passionate sighes, lowdnesse of
voyce, odde attires &amp; such like: These
know how to rend the garment, hang
the head with the bulrush, to whip and
launce their skinnes with <i>Baals</i> Priests;
and yet strangers to a wounded spirit:
not but that true and hearty zeale doth
lift up the eyes, knocke the breast, dance
before the Arke. Therefore this character
may deceive the unwarie; Let
<i>Ely</i> take heede of judging <i>Hanna's</i> Spirit
rashly by the mooving of her lips: yet
hypocrites so usually straine nature and
without a cause exceed, and that in publique,
and upon the stage, that for the
most part, their actions and affections
are palpable: as <i>Jesuites, Cappuchins</i>, &amp;c.
yea in many histrionicall Protestants:
Horse-coursers jades will bound, curvet
and shew more tricks, then a horse well
mettled for the rode or cart.</p>

<div class="sidenote_l">3. Complementall.</div>

<p>Thirdly, you may know them by
their diligence and curiositie in lighter
matters joyned with omission and neglect
of greater, wise in circumstance, and
carelesse in substance, tithing mint, straining
at gnats, &amp;c. In all cheape and easie
duties, prodigall: niggardly &amp; slothfull
in the waighty things of the Law:
these have at command good words,
countenance, yea teares from their eyes,
sooner then a farthing from their purse,
having this worlds goods, and see their
brother want; these sticke up feathers
for the carcasse, beguiling the simple,
couzening the world, but cheefly themselves.</p>

<div class="sidenote_l">4. Pragmaticall.</div>

<div class="sidenote_l">5. Censorious.</div>

<div class="sidenote_l">6. Cruell.</div>

<p>Fourthly, these fires cannot keepe
themselves within their owne hearths,
these spirits cannot keepe themselves
within their owne circles. True zeale
loves to keepe home, studieth to bee
quiet in other mens Dioces: false zeale
loves to be gadding, is eagle-ey'd abroad
and mole-ey'd at home: Insteed of burning
bright and shining cleere; like brinish
lights, they sparkle &amp; spet at others,
or like ill couched fire-workes let fly on
all sides: onely out of their wisdome
they know how to spare <i>Agag</i> and the
great ones, and bee sure they anger not
their great Masters, and meddle with
their matches: whereas it is the property
of fire that comes from above, to
spare the yeelding sheath, and melt the
resisting mettall, to passe by the lower
roofes, and strike the towred pinacle, as
<i>Nathan, David; Elias, Ahab; John, Herod;
Jonas, Ninivie; &amp;c.</i> Note also in all their
proceeding with others, in steede of
wholesome severity (which rightly zealous
men never come unto but by compulsion,
and not without compassion
of the offender, weeping with <i>Moses</i> and
<i>Samuel</i> over the people, beeing sory
with the Emperour, that they know
how to write sentences of condemnation)
These delight in cruelty, the brand
of the Malignant Church; feede their
eyes with Massacres, as the Queene-mother.
No diet so pleasing to these ravening
wolves, as the warme blood of
the sheepe. These are they that cry fire
and fagot, away with them, not worthy
to live, their very mercies are cruelty:
especially in their owne cause, they heat
the fornace seaven times hotter then in
Gods.</p>

<div class="sidenote_l">7. Variable and inconstant.</div>

<p>Lastly, these Meteors and Vapours
have no constant light, or continued
heat (as the fixed starres ever like themselves)
but have onely their aguish fits,
&amp; lunatick moods; sometimes in adversity
they are good under the rod, as <i>Pharaoh</i>,
againe in prosperity like the fat kine
of <i>Bashan</i>, ingratefull and forgetfull:
sometimes in prosperity when the sunne
of peace shineth on them, &amp; the favourable
influence of great ones, they shoot
foorth their blade with the corne on the
house top, running with the streame, &amp;
sayling with the winde; sometimes their
zeale depends upon the life of <i>Jehoiada</i>;
sometimes on the company of the Prophets:
commonly in the beginning they
blaze like straw-fire, but in the end goe
out in smoake and smother; whereas in
their entrance into profession, they galloped
into shewes, and made some girds
at hand, they tire, give in, and end in the
flesh, whereas all naturall motions are
swiftest toward their end.</p>

<p>The vestall fires were perpetuall, and
the fire of the Altar never went out.
Spices and wefts of these evills may bee
found in the sincerest Christians: but
they suffer not these dead flies to lie and
putrefie in the precious boxes of true
zeale; of all these the Preachers caveat
may be construed, <i>Be not over just</i>, though
it may also admit other interpretations,
as after shall appeare.</p>

<p>These are the speciall notes and symptomes
of strange fires: the kinds also are
many, and might be distributed into many
heads; but I will reduce them into
three, which are known by their names.

<i>turbulent Zeale, wilde fire</i>.</p>

<p>The first, wanting truth and sincerity,
propounds sinister ends.</p>

<p>The second, knowledge and discretion,
takes wrong wayes.</p>

<p>The third, love and humility, exceeds
measure.</p>

<p>The first abounds amongst subtile &amp;
crafty professours, and is to be abhorred
and detected.</p>

<p>The second among simple &amp; devout,
is to be pitied and directed.</p>

<p>The third amongst passionate and affectionate,
and is to bee moderated and
corrected.</p>

<p>The first is the meere vizor of zeale,
looking asquint one way and tending
another; pretending God and his glory,
intending some private and sinister end;
first, either of honour and promotion,
as <i>Jehu</i>, who marched furiously, and his
word was the Lord of hosts, but his project
was the kingdome.</p>

<p>Secondly, at filthy lucre: as <i>Demetrius</i>
and his followers, who cried great is
<i>Diana</i> of Ephesus; but meant her little
silver shrines. It cannot bee denied, but
many such there were, who helped to
pull downe the Abbyes; not out of any
hatred to those uncleane cages, but to
reare their owne houses out of the ruines,
and spoyled copes to make cushions.
<i>Judas</i> complained of superfluity,
but greeved it fell besides his bag: many
hold temporalities tithes and glebes,
unlawfull, because they are loth to forgo
them: If <i>Jezebel</i> proclaime a Fast, let
<i>Naboth</i> looke to his vine-yard; If the Usurer
&amp; Trades-man frequent Sermons,
let the buyer &amp; borrower look to themselves.
It is too common a thing to make
zeale a lure &amp; stale, to draw customers;
a bait of fraud, a net to entrap; with malicious
<i>Doegs</i>, to make it a stalking horse
for revenge against the Priest, thereby
to discharge their gall at Ministers and
other Christians, for the omission and
commission of such things, as themselves
care not for; with the <i>Strumpet</i> in
the Proverbs, to wipe their mouthes,
and frequent the Sacrifices, that they
may be free from suspicion.</p>

<p>All these evils, have I seene under
the sunne-shine of the Gospell: but by
how much, zeale is more glorious then
common profession, by so much is dissembled
fervency more detestable then
usuall hypocrisie; yea, no better then
divellish villany &amp; double iniquity: such
painted walles and whited sepulchers,
the Lord will breake downe. Let all
<i>Timothies</i> &amp; <i>Nathanaels</i> learne to descry
them, and discard them: The cure of
this was deepely forelayd by Christ; <i>I
counsell thee to buy gold tried in the fire</i>: all
is not gold that glistereth, an image of
faith breeds but a shew of zeale; many
seemed to trust in Christ, but Christ
would not trust them: but such faith as
will abide the fire, brings foorth zeale
that will abide the touch-stone.</p>

<p>The second is erroneous or blinde
zeale, not according to knowledge,
Rom. 10. I beare many devout Papists
witnesse (though I feare the learnedst
of them be selfe-condemned) that they
have this zeale, perswading themselves
they doe God best service, when they
please the Divell most in their will-worship.
The same witnesse I beare many
<i>Seperatists</i>; though I feare most of them
be sicke of selfe-conceitednesse, newfanglenesse,
and desire of mastership: for
who would not suspect such zeale, which
condemnes all reformed Churches, and
refuseth communion with such as they
themselves confesse to bee Christians,
and consequentely such as have communion
with Christ? It would greeve
a man indeede, to see zeale misplaced,
like mettle in a blinde horse; to see men
take such paines, and yet fall into the
pit. This made <i>Paul</i> to wish himselfe
<i>Anathema</i>, for the sake of such; and yet
the multitude and common people, reason
thus; Is it possible but these men
have the right? But alas, how should it
bee otherwise, when a blinde company
will follow a blinde sect-master; This
being one property of blinde zeale, a
fond admiration and apish imitation of
some person, for some excellency they
see in him, which so dazles their eyes,
that they cannot discerne their errours
and infirmities, which they oftner inherit
then their vertues; as appeares in
the <i>Lutherans</i> and the Jewes, that would
sacrifice their children to <i>Molech</i>, in imitation
of <i>Abraham</i>: In these the Divell
becomes an Angell of light, and playeth
that Dragon, Revel. 12. powring out
flouds of persecution against the
Church, causing devout men and women,
to raise tragedies, breath out threatnings,
and persecute without measure;
then these the Divell hath no better soldiers:
but when their scales fall from
their eyes, and they come into Gods
tents; God hath none like unto them.
The cure of this divinely is forelayd by
Christ also, to buy eye-salve of him;
Angells have eyes as well as wings to
guide their flight: when the ship is under
saile, and hath the freshest way; it
hath most neede to looke to the sterage,
keep the watch, have an eye to the Compasse
and land-marks.</p>

<p>The third kinde is turbulent zeale,
called by <i>James</i> bitter zeale, a kinde of
wilde-fire transporting men beyond all
bounds and compasse of moderation;
proceeding sometime of a weaknesse
of nature in men, that have no stay of
their passion, like to Clockes whose
springs are broken, and Cities whose
walls are down. Zeale is a good servant,
but an ill master: mettle is dangerous in
a head-strong horse. And so the Poets
(which were the Heathens Prophets)
shadowed out the cure of this, in <i>Minerva's</i>
golden bridle, wherewith she menaged
her winged <i>Pegasus</i>. There is too
much of this bitter zeale, of this <i>Hierapicra</i>
in all our bookes of controversies:
but especially there hath been too much
in our domesticall warrs; some sonns
of <i>Bichri</i> have blowen the trumpet of
contention, trumpets of anger; the
Churches of God should have no such
custome: Oh that our Churches understood
that saying.</p>

<div class="sidenote_r">Rom. 14. 10.</div>

<p>In quarrells of this nature <i>Paul</i> spends
his zeale, not in partaking but in parting
the fray, beating downe the weapons
on both sides: Who art thou that
judgest? who art thou that condemnest
thy brother? as if hee should say, The
matters are not <i>Tanti</i>, wee have made
the Divell too much sport already; who
threw in these bones to set us together
by the eares, whilst hee lets in the common
Enemy upon us. <i>Charitie, Charitie</i>,
is the builder of Churches: Strife about
trifles, hath wasted many famous
ones, and placed the temples of <i>Mahomet</i>,
where the golden candle-sticke was
wont to stand. Wee pitty the former ages,
contending about leavened and unleavened
bread, keeping of Easter, fasting
on Sundayes, &amp;c. The future ages,
will do the like for us. Oh that the Lord
would put into the hearts both of the
governours &amp; parties to these quarrells,
once to make an end of these Midianitish
warrs; that wee might joyntly powre
out the vialls of our zeale upon the
throne of the beast.</p>

<p>Thus have you heard the errors and
counterfets of zeale, through whose
sides, and upon the backe of which,
divers of the malicious world use to
beat those whom it hates, because their
workes are better then their owne; injuriously
concluding, that all Zelots are
alike. Thus I have heard our Marchants
complaine, that the set up blewes have
made strangers loath the rich oaded
blewes, onely in request; this is an olde
sophisme. True judgement would teach
us to conclude, that the best druggs have
their adulterates; the most current coins
their slipps; and that vertue which so
many hypocrites put on, to grace themselves
withall; is surely some rare and
excellent jewell.</p>
<br />

<p><i>The third part.</i></p>

<p>The true Zelot, whose fervency is
in the spirit, not in shew; in substance
not in circumstance; for God, not himselfe;
guided by the word, not with
humours; tempered with charity, not
with bitternesse: such a mans praise is
of God though not of men: such a mans
worth cannot bee set foorth with the
tongues of men and Angells.</p>

<div class="sidenote_l">Arguments of commendation.</div>

<p>Oh that I had so much zeale, as to
steep it in it owne liquour; to set it forth
in it owne colours, that the Lord would
touch my tongue with a coale from his
Altar, that I might regaine the decayed
credit of it, with the sons of men.</p>

<div class="sidenote_l">1. From God's excellency whom zeale<br/>only becomes unworthily placed elsewhere.</div>

<p>It is good to bee zealous in a good
things: and is it not best, in the best? or
is there any better then God, or the
kingdome of heaven? Is it comely what
ever we do, to do it with all our might?
onely uncomely when wee serve God?
Is meane and mediocrity, in all excellent
Arts excluded, and onely to be admitted
in religion? Were it not better
to forbeare <i>Poetry</i> or <i>Painting</i>, then to
rime or dawbe? and were it not better
to bee of no religion, then to be colde or
lukewarme in any? Is it good to be earnest
for a friend, &amp; cold for the Lord of
hosts? For whom doest thou reserve the
top of thy affections? for thy gold? for
thy <i>Herodias</i>, &amp;c. O yee adulterers and
adultresses, can yee offer God a baser indignity?
What ayleth the world? Is it
afrayd thinke we, that God can have too
much love; who in regard of his owne
infinite beauty, &amp; the beames he vouchsafeth
to cast upon us, deserves the best,
yea all, and a thousand times more then
all? Ought not all the springs and
brookes of our affection, to runne into
this Maine? may not hee justly disdaine,
that the least Riveret should bee drained
another way? that any thing in the world
should bee respected before him, equalled
with him, or loved out of him, of
whom, for whom, and through whom
are all things? Who, or what can bee
sufficient for him our Maker and Saviour?
In other objects feare excesse: here
no extasie is high enough.</p>

<div class="sidenote_l">2. From his spirituall nature.</div>

<p>Consider and reason thus with thy
selfe (O man) canst thou brooke a sluggard
in thy worke, if thou bee of any
spirit thy selfe? is not a slothfull messenger
as vinegar to thy teeth, and as
smoake to thine eyes? Hast thou any
sharpnesse of wit, is not dulnesse tedious
unto thee? And shall hee that is all
spirit (for whom the Angels are slow
and colde enough) take pleasure in thy
drowzie and heavie service? Doe men
choose the forwardest Deere in the
heard, and the liveliest Colt in the
drove? and is the backwardest man
fittest for God? Is not all his delight in
the quickest and cheerefullest givers and
servitors? Even to <i>Judas</i> he saith, That
thou doest, doe quickely; so odious is
dulnesse unto him: what else mooved
him to ordaine, that the necke of the
consecrated Asse should bee broken, rather
then offered up in sacrifice; doth
God hate the Asse? Or is it not for the
sake of the quality of the creature;
which hath ever among the Heathens
beene an <i>Hieroglyphick</i> of heavinesse and
tardity?</p>

<div class="sidenote_l">3. Effects of zeale. Revel. 12.</div>

<div class="sidenote_r">Opus operatum.</div>

<p>Thirdly, this zeale is so gracious a favorite
with God, that it graces with him
all the rest of his graces. Prayer if it bee
fervent, prevaileth much: the zealous
witnesses had power to shut and open
heaven: by this, <i>Israel</i> wrastled with
God, overcame, and was called a Prince
with God: this strengthned the heart of
<i>Moses</i> (as <i>Aaron</i> and <i>Hur</i> supported
his hands) till the Lord sayd, Let me alone:
this made <i>Cornelius</i> his prayer
to come into heaven; whither our colde
sutes can no more ascend, then vapours
from the Still, unlesse there bee fire under
it: Repentance, a needefull and primary
grace, which the Baptist so urged:
but then wee must bee zealous and
repent (as my text joynes them) or
else no repentance pleaseth God; nor
are there fruits worthy repentance.
Almes and good deeds are sacrifices
pleasing to God; but without zeale, the
widowes mites are no better then the
rest; It is the cheerefull loose, that doubleth
the gift. Generally, as some mans
marke and name, furthereth the sale of
his commodity; so zeale inhanceth all
the graces of God. It pittieth me for <i>Laodicea</i>
that lost so much cost; had as many
vertues, did as many duties as other
Churches: but for want of this, Christ
could not sup with them. Furnish a table
with the principallest fare, and daintiest
dishes that may be had; let them be
rosted &amp; boyled to the halves, or stand
on the table till they bee lukewarme;
what will the guests say? All that we can
doe is but the deede done, unlesse zeale
conferre grace.</p>

<div class="sidenote_l">4. Baptismus Flaminis &amp; Fluminis.</div>

<p>Fourthly, zeale is the richest evidence
of faith, and the cleerest demonstration
of the Spirit: The Baptisme of water,
is but a cold proofe of a mans Christendome;
being common to all commers:
but if any bee baptized with fire,
the same is sealed up to the day of Redemption.
If any shall say, friend, what
doest thou professe a religion without it;
how can hee choose but bee strucke
dumb? Can wee suppose worme-wood
without bitternesse, a man without reason?
then may wee imagine a religion,
and a Christian, without spirit and zeale.</p>

<p>The Jesuite saith, I am zealous; the
Separatist, I am zealous; their plea is
more probable, then the lukewarme
worldlings, that serve God without
life. If the colour bee pale and wan, and
the motion insensible, the party is dead
or in a swoune; if good and swift, wee
make no question. The zealous Christian
is never to seeke for a proofe
of his salvation: what makes one Christian
differ from another in grace, as
starrs doe in glory; but zeale? All beleevers
have a like precious faith: All
true Christians have all graces in their
seedes; but the degrees of them are no
way better discerned then by zeale:
Men of place distinguish themselves, by
glistering pearles: A Christian of degrees
shines above other in zeale. Comparisons
I know are odious to the
world, that faine would have all alike:
but the righteous is better then his
neighbour: All Christians are the excellent
of the earth, the Zelot surmounteth
them all, as <i>Saul</i> the people by the
head and shoulders; hee is ever striving
to excell and exceeds others and himselfe.</p>

<p>One of these is worth a thousand others,
one doth the worke of many:
which made him speake of <i>Elisha</i> in
the plurall number, <i>The horsemen and
Charriots of Israel</i>; besides his owne
worke, hee winns and procures others,
makes Proselytes. It is the nature of fire
to multiply, one coale kindles another:
his worke so shines, that others come in
and glorifie God; marvelling and enquiring
what such forwardnesse should
meane, concluding with <i>Nebuchadnezzar,
Surely the servants of the most high God.</i></p>

<p>These are good Factors and Agents,
doing God as good service, as Boutesewes
doe the Divell, and Jesuites the
Pope, sparing no cost, nor labour; and
what they cannot doe themselves, they
doe by their friends, <i>Who is on my side,
who? &amp;c.</i></p>

<p>As for lets and impediments, they
over-looke and over-leape them, as fire
passeth from one house to another; neither
is there any standing for any Gods
enemies before them: they make havock
of their owne and others corruptions.
If you will rightly conceive of <i>Peters</i>
zeale in converting &amp; confounding,
you must imagine (saith <i>Chrysostome</i>) a
man made all of fire walking in stubble.
All difficulties are but whetstones of
their fortitude. The sluggard saith,
<i>There is a Lyon in the way</i>; tell <i>Samson</i> &amp;
<i>David</i> so, they will the rather goe out to
meet them. Tell <i>Nehemiah of Samballat</i>,
hee answereth, <i>Shall such a man as I
feare?</i> Tell <i>Caleb</i> there are <i>Anakims</i>, and
hee will say, <i>Let us goe upp at once, &amp;c</i>.
Let <i>Agabus</i> put off his girdle and binde
<i>Paul</i>, let him be told in every City, that
bonds await him, hee is not onely ready
for bonds, but for death; tell <i>Jubentius</i>,
hee must lay downe his life, he is as
willing as to lay off his clothes: tell <i>Luther</i>
of enemies in <i>Wormes</i>, hee will goe
if all the tiles of the houses were Divells.
The horse neighs at the trumpet; the
Leviathan laughs at the speare. They
that meane to take the Kingdome of
God by violence, provide themselves
to goe through fire and water, carry
their lives in their hands, embrace faggots;
they say to father and mother, <i>I
know you not</i>: to carnall Counsellers and
friendly enemies, <i>Get you behinde mee
Sathan.</i> Zeale is as strong as death, hot
as the coales of Juniper; flouds of many
waters cannot quench it. <i>Agar</i>, Pro. 30.
speakes of foure things, stately in their
kinde; I will make bold to add a fift,
comprehending and excelling them all
namely the zealous Christian, strong
and bold as the Lyon; not turning his
head for any; as swift as the grey-hound
in the waies of Gods commandements;
in the race to heaven, as nimble as the
Goat climbing the steepe and craggy
mountaines of pietie and vertue; A
victorious King, overcoming the world
and his lusts: <i>Salomon</i> in all his royalty,
is not cloathed like one of these in his
fiery Charriot.</p>

<p>To cut off the infinite praises of zeale,
let us heare what honourable testimonies
and glorious rewards, it pleaseth
God to conferre upon it; <i>Davids</i> ruddy
complexion and his skill in musique,
made him amiable in the eyes of men:
but the zeale of his heart, stiled him a
man after Gods owne heart; and the
sweet Singer of Israel. <i>Abraham</i>, that
could finde in his heart to sacrifice his
<i>Isaack</i>, was called the friend of God.
The same vertue denominated <i>Jacob
</i> a Prince with God. <i>Elisha</i>, The Charriots
and horse-men. <i>Paul</i>, A chosen
vessell, &amp;c.</p>

<div class="sidenote_r">Revel. 12.</div>

<div class="sidenote_r">Revel. 7. 3. Ezek. 9. Exod. 12.</div>

<p>Neither doth God put them off, with
names and empty favours, but upon
these he bestowes his graces: <i>David</i> dedicateth
his Psalmes to him that excelled:
God in dispensing of favours, observeth
the same rule, to him that overcommeth
will I give, &amp;c, To him
that hath, shall bee given. Husbandmen
cast their seede uppon the fertilest
ground, which returnes it with the
greatest interest: God gives most talents
to those that improove them in
the best banke. <i>Joseph</i> shall have a party
coloured coat, of all kindes of graces
and blessings: And because he knowes
this will purchase them hatred and envy,
hee takes them into speciall tuition;
if any will hurt his zealous witnesses,
there goeth out a fire out of their
mouthes, to devoure their enemies. A
man were better anger all the witches
in the world then one of these. If God
bring any common judgements, he sets
his seale and <i>Thau</i> on their fore-heads, &amp;
sprinkles their posts; snatcheth <i>Lot</i> out
of the fire (who burneth in zeale, as <i>Sodome</i>
in lust) as men doe their plate
whiles they let the baser stuffe burne.
In fine, hee taketh <i>Enoch</i> and <i>Eliah</i> in triumphant
Charriots up to heaven, and
after their labours and toyles, setteth
them in speciall Thrones, to rest in glory;
The Apostles in their twelve, the
rest in their order, according to their
zeale. And though hee may well reckon
the best of these, unprofitable servants;
yet such congruity (not of merits,
but of favour) it pleaseth him to
observe in crowning his graces, that the
most zealous heere, are the most glorious
there.</p>

<p>Who would not now wonder, how
ever this royall vertue should have lost
it grace with the world; how ever any
should admit a low thought of it? But
what? Shall all the indignity which hell
can cast upon it, make it vile in our eyes?
or rather, shall wee not reason from the
opposition, as <i>Tertullian</i> did of <i>Nero:
</i> That religion which <i>Nero</i> so persecutes,
must needs be excellent.</p>

<div class="sidenote_l">1 Object. Zeale is madd, and makes men mad.</div>

<div class="sidenote_r">Acts 26. 24 1 Cor.</div>

<p>If zeale were not some admirable
good, the Divell and World would not
so hate it; Yet lest silence should bee
thought to baulke some unanswerable
reasons, let us see how they labour to
be madd with reason: Let <i>Festus</i> bee the
Speaker for the rest, for hee speakes what
all the rest thinke; you know his madd
objection, and <i>Pauls</i> sober answer in
that place, and the like, 2 Cor. 5.13.
whether hee bee madd or sober, it is for
God and you.</p>

<p>This text bids us bee zealous and repent;
the word signifies be wise againe,
or returne to your wits. The prodigall
is sayd to come to himselfe, when he was
first heat with this fire. Wee may well
answer the world as old men doe young:
You thinke us Christians to bee madd

Christs owne kindred were afrayd

of new wine; besides, with these the

made for himselfe. This is a stale imputation
in ages. <i>Haman</i> accused <i>Mordechay</i>
and the Jewes of it. The Apostles
are sayd to bee troubles of the
whole earth. In the Primitive Church
all mutinies and contentions were layd
to the Martyrs. True it is, where zeale is,
there is opposition, and so consequently
troubles: Christ sets this fire on earth,
not as an author, but by accident: The
theefe is the authour of the fray, though
the true man strike never so many

trouble Israel; then, complaine of <i>Eliah:

the onely springs that set their wheeles

<div class="sidenote_l">4 Object. They keep no meane.</div>

<p>When slaundering will not serve,
then fall they to glavering, cunningly
glancing at zeale, whiles they commend
the golden meane wherein vertue consists.
But Christians, take heede
none spoyle you through such Philosophy;
or rather Sopistry: for true Philosophy
will tell you that the meane
wherein vertue is placed, is the middle
betwixt two kindes, and not degrees:
And it is but meane vertue that loves
the meane in their sense.</p>

<div class="sidenote_l">5 Object. Undiscreet.</div>

<p>Oh say they, but some discretion
would doe well; It is true, but take
withall <i>Calvins</i> caveat to <i>Melancthon</i>:
That he affect not so the name of a moderate
man, and listen to such Syrens
songs, till he lose his zeale.</p>

<p>I have observed, that which the
world miscalls discretion, to eat upp
zeale, as that which they call policy,
doth wisdome. As <i>Joab</i> stabbed <i>Abner</i>
under a colour of friendship: Antichrist
undermineth Christ, by pretending
to be his Vicar. The feare of overdoing
makes most come too short; of
the two extreamities, wee should most
feare lukewarmnesse: rather let your
milke boyle over then be raw.</p>

<p>From glavering, they fall to scoffing;
yong Saints, will prove but olde Divels;
these hot-spurrs will soone runne themselves
out of breath. But wee say, such
were never right bred; such as proove
falling starres, never were ought but
meteors; the other never lose light or
motion: spirituall motions may be violent
and perpetuall.</p>

<p>When none of these will take, they fal
to right downe rayling; these Puritans,
these singular fellowes, &amp;c. unfit for
all honest company. I hope the states
Puritan, and the common Puritan bee
two creatures. For with that staffe the
multitude beats all that are better then
themselves, &amp; lets fly at all that have any
shew of goodnes. But with that which
most call Puritanisme, I desire to worship
God. For singularity, Christs calls
for it, and presseth &amp; urgeth it; What
singular thing doe you, or what odde
thing doe you? Shall Gods peculiar
people, doe nothing peculiar? The
world thinkes it strange, wee runne not
with them into excesses, and doe not as
most doe, that wee might escape derision:
Judge you which of these men shall
please: I beleeve none shall ever please
Christ, till they appeare odde, strange
and precise men, to the common sort;
and yet neede not bee over just neither
Let them that have tender eares stop
them against the charmes of the world,
and scornes of <i>Michol</i>, unlesse they
were wiser: Let him that hath a right
eare, heare what Christ saith to the
Churches, <i>Be zealous</i>.</p>

<p><i>The fourth part.</i></p>

<div class="sidenote_l">Incentives.</div>

<p>Yea, but by what meanes shall a Christian
attaine this fire, and maintaine it
when he hath gotten it.</p>

<p>Say not in thine heart, What <i>Prometheus</i>
shall ascend into heaven and fetch
it thence; thou mayest fetch it thence
by thine owne prayer: as did<i>Elias</i> and
the Apostles, men of infirmities as
well as thy selfe; pray continually, and
instantly: the Lord that breathed first
thy soule into thee, will also breath on
thy soule: I speake not of miraculous
(which was but a type) but of ordinarie
inspiration. Prayer and zeale are
as water and ice: mutually producing
each other; when it is once come
downe upon thine altar; though no water
can quench it, yet must it bee preserved
fresh, by ordinarie fuell; especially
the Priests lipps must keepe it alive.</p>

<p>Sermons are bellowes ordained for
this purpose. The word read is of divine
use, but doth not with that motion
stirre these coales.</p>

<p>Experience sheweth, the best oration
will not so much moove as the meanest
Orator.</p>

<p>After the sparkles once by these
meanes kindled, cherish and feede them
by reading the word: Let it dwell richly
in thine heart, excite thy dulnesse by
spirituall Hymnes. Love-songs enflame
not lust, more, then the Song of
Songs doth zeale: Reade or sing the
119. Psalme; and if thou beest not zealous,
every verse will checke thee in thy
throat: Meditation is another helpe,
approoved by <i>Isaacks</i> and <i>Davids</i> practice:
An Art lately so taught, as I shall
neede onely to poynt at the choyce
theames, suiting and furthering this argument.
I need not goe far to fetch this
fire: I may strike it out of every word
of this Epistle to <i>Laodicea</i>. Behold the
Lord God, especially thy Lord Christ
in his glorious titles and Majesty; for
so hee beginnes his visions to <i>John</i>;
and his Epistles to the Churches, exciting
their dull hearts. By such apparitions
did hee set on fire the heart of
<i>Moses</i> in the burning bush; and enflamed
<i>Stephan</i>, his first Martyr: answerable
and proportionable to which,
are our serious contemplations. Behold
him as one that seeth thee, and knoweth
thy workes; the rouzing preface of all
these Letters. <i>Casars</i> eye made his souldiers
prodigall of their blood. The Atheist
thinks God takes as much notice
of him and his prayers, as hee doth of
the humming of Flyes and Bees; and
therefore, no marvell if his service bee
formall and fashionable. The faithfull
Christian by faiths prospective sees him
at home, and heares him saying, Well
done thou good servant; which maketh
him to worke out his heart. Behold
him as the beginning of creatures, especially
of the new creature. Oh! what
love hath hee shewed thee in thy redemption?
out of what misery, into
what happinesse, by what a price, to
what end; but that thou shouldest bee
zealous of good workes? Behold him
as the faithfull witnesse, that witnessed
himselfe for thee a good witnesse,
and heere faithfully counsels thee to follow
his patterne. Behold him as a speedie
and royall rewarder of his followers.
Take thy selfe into paradise, represent
to thy selfe thy crowne, thy throne,
thy white robes; looke not on the
things that are seene, but on the farre
most excellent wait of glory; looke
upon these, and faint if thou canst.
Behold also hee is a consuming fire, a
zealous God, hating lukewarmnesse
not onely destroying <i>Sodome</i> with fire
and brimstone, and providing <i>Tophet</i>
for his enemies; but awaking also his
drowzie servants, by judgements (as
<i>Absolon Joab</i> by firing his corne) his
Israelites by fiery serpents: whom hee
loveth, hee chasteneth, and keepeth
them in the fornace of fiery trialls, till
they come to their right temper. Hee
standeth and knocketh: if nothing will
arouze us, a time will come, when heaven
and earth shall burne with fire, and
Christ shall come in flaming fire, to
render vengeance with fire unquenchable.
Wee therefore that know the terrour
of that day, What manner of persons
ought we to bee?</p>

<p>From God turne thine eyes unto
man: set before thee the pillar, and
clowde of fiery examples, that have
led us the way into Canaan. Hee is but
a dull lade that will not follow: The
stories of the Scriptures, the lives of
the Fathers, the acts and monuments
of the Church, have a speciall vertue for
this effect. The very pictures of the fires,
and Martyrs, cannot but warme thee.
If thou canst meete with any living examples,
follow them, as they follow
Christ, frequent their company: even
<i>Saul</i> amongst the Prophets, will prophesie.
No bangling hawke, but with a
high flyer will mend her pitch: the
poorest good companion, will doe thee
some good; when <i>Silas</i> came, <i>Paul</i>
burnt in the spirit: a lesser sticke may
fire a billet; If thou findest none, let
the coldnesse of the times heat thee,
as frosts doe the fire; Let every indignation
make thee zealous, as the dunstery
of the Monkes, made <i>Erasmus</i> studious:
one way to bee rich in times of
dearth, is to engrosse a rare commodity,
such as zeale is: now, if ever, <i>they have
destroyed thy Law</i>; It is now high time to
be zealous.</p>

<p>Consider and emulate the children
of this generation, to see how eager every
<i>Demas</i> is for worldly promotion.
How did that worthy Bishop disdaine
to see an harlot, more curiously to adorne
her body unto sinne and death,
then hee could his soule unto life everlasting.
It angred <i>Demosthenes</i> to see a
Smith earlier at his anvile, then he was
at his deske.</p>

<p>When thou hast thus heat thy selfe,
take heede of catching colde againe, as
many have done, and brought their
zeale to deaths doore.</p>

<div class="sidenote_l">Zeales extinguishers.</div>

<p>This fire may goe out divers wayes:
first by subtraction of fewell; if a man
forbeare his accustomed meales, will
not his naturall heat decay? The <i>Levites</i>
that kept Gods watch in the Temple,
were charged expressely, morning
&amp; evening, if not oftner, to looke to the
lights and the fire. Hee that shall forget
(at the least) with the <i>Curfeau-bell</i> in
the evening to rake uppe his zeale by
prayer, and with the day-bell in the
morning to stirre up &amp; kindle the same,
if not oftner with <i>Daniel</i>; I cannot conceive
how hee can possibly keepe fire in
his heart. Will God blesse such, as bid
him not so much as good-morrow and
good-even?</p>

<p>Hee that shall despise or neglect prophesie,
must hee not needes quench the
spirit? have I not marked glorious professors,
who for some farme sake, or other
commodities, have flitted from Jerusalem
to Jericho; where the situation
was good, but the waters nought; and
their zeale hath perished, because vision
hath failed?</p>

<p>Such as reade the Bible by fits upon
rainy dayes, not eating the booke with
<i>John</i>, but tasting onely with the tippe of
the tongue: Such as meditate by snatches,
never chewing the cud and digesting
their meat, they may happily get
a smackering, for discourse and table-talke;
but not enough to keepe soule
&amp; life together, much lesse for strength
and vigour. Such as forsake the best fellowship,
and wax strange to holy assemblies, (as now the manner of many
is) how can they but take colde? Can
one coale alone keepe it selfe glowing?</p>

<p>Though it goe not out for want of
matter, yet may it bee put out by sundry
accidents; when it is newly kindled, it
may be put out with scoffes and reproaches,
if <i>Peter</i> take not heede, and fence
himselfe well against them; but if once
throughly growne, such breath will but
spred and encrease it.</p>

<p>It is possible fire may bee oppressed
with too much wood, and heat suffocated
with too much nourishment: over-much
prayer, reading, and study, may
bee a wearinesse both to flesh and spirit:
but it so rarely happeneth, that I
neede not mention it; and yet the soule
hath its satiety. There be some such perchance
over-nice men in this sense also,
who have not learned that God
will have them mercifull to themselves:
It is often smoothered for want of
vent and exercise. Let such as use not
and expresse not their zeale, bragge of
their good hearts; surely they have
none such, or not like to have them
such. If <i>Nicodemus</i> had not buried
Christ by day, we might have feared his
zeale had gone out, for all his comming
by night.</p>

<p>Yet this is not so ordinary, as to extinguish
it by the quench-coale of sinne;
grosse sinne every man knowes will
waste the conscience, and make shipwracke
of zeale: but I say, the least
known evill unrepented of, is as a theefe
in the candle, or an obstruction in the
liver. I feare, <i>David</i> served God but reasonably,
till hee published his repentance;
hee that steales his meat, though
poverty tempt him, yet giveth thankes
but coldly: zeale and sinne, will soone
expell the one or the other out of their
subject; Can you imagine in the same
roofe, God and Beliall, the Arke and
Dagon? Lastly, and most commonly,
forraine heat will extract the inward,
and adventicious heat consume the naturall.</p>

<p>The Sunne will put out the fire; and
so will the love of the world, the love
of the Father, they cannot stand together
in intense degrees, one cannot
serve both these matters with such affection
as both would have. Seldome
seest thou a man make haste to bee rich,
and thrive in religion. Christs message
to <i>John</i> holds true; The poore are most
forward in receiving and following the
Gospell: as thou lovest thy zeale, beware
of resolving to bee rich, lest gain
proove thy godlinesse; take heede of
ambitious aspiring, lest Courts and
great places, proove ill aires for zeale,
whither it is as easie to go zealous, as to
returne wise: <i>Peter</i> whiles hee warmed
his hands, cooled his heart; Not that
greatnesse and zeale cannot agree; but
for that our weaknes many times severs
them. If thou beest willing to die poore
in estate, thou mayest the more easily
live rich in grace. <i>Smyrna</i>, the poorest
of the seven Candle-stickes, hath the richest
price upon it.</p>

will make easie the practise of this counsell,

<p>Which little round fire-ball comming to hand,
as <i>Davids</i> small stone, by

his arme would scatter it farre and
wide into those wilde parts of the
world without the pale of Christendome,
which lie so frozen and benummed in
their Paganisme, that they feele
not the coldnesse of their religions; as
also in those regions that being within
the Tropickes of the Church, have
just so much, and so little heat, as to
thinke they have enough, and neede no
more: Cheefly mine affections burne
within mee for the good of mine owne
Nation, for which I would I had but so
much zeale as truely to wish my selfe
<i>Anathema</i>, upon condition it had heat
sutable to the light. For I must beare it
record, it hath knowledge, I would I
could say, according to zeale. But the
spirit, knowing that which is spoken to
all to bee in effect as spoken to none,
directs mee what I should speake to
Churches, to speake to particular Angels.
Now the principall in our Church,
under that Archangell of the covenant,
I most willingly acknowledge to bee
my Lord the King, as an Angell of
light. And why not that very Angell,
who by his writing hath begunne to
powre out the fift viall upon the throne
of the beast, darkned his Kingdome,
caused them to gnaw their tongues for
greefe, and blaspheme for the smart of
their wounds; though as yet they will
not repent of their errours? The Lord
annoynt him more and more with this
oyle above all the Princes of the earth,
that from his head, it may runne downe
upon our skirts; make him shine in
zeale above all other starres, to the
warming &amp; enlightning of this whole
Horizon; set him up as a standard for
his people; cloath him with zeale, as
with a cloake, to recompence the fury
of the adversaries, that he may strike
the Aramites, not three but five times
till they be consumed; that he may put
the Ammonites under the yron sawes,
harrowes, axes, which have provoked
him as much, as ever they did <i>David</i>,
2. Sam. 12. But yet as in the time of
the old Testament the custody of the
fire and light was the charge of the
Priest; so here I observe Christ to lay
it upon his Ministers, interpreting his
rule by his practise, <i>Tell the church,
Tell the Angell of the Church</i>; honouring
that despised office, with that stately
stile; intimating the union betwene
People and Minister, that they should
bee as one: what is spoken to the one, is
spoken to the other; not as some, that ever
make Clergy and Layty two members,
in division and opposition; neither
yet as some spirites that lay all level,
but implying a property, especially
in grace and zeale in the Ministers,
whom the Preacher calls the master of
the assemblies; that they should exceede
as farre the people, as Angels doe
men, and that he will reckon with them
for the religion of the people, because
colde Priests make bolde sinners; zealous
<i>Jehoiada</i> may mak <i>Jehoash</i> the King
zealous, so long as hee lives with him.
Wee therefore men and brethren, or
rather men and Angels, upon whom
it lies to keepe life and heat in the devotion
of the world, to consume the
drosse of vices and heresies, that have
fallen into the sinke of our times; wee
that are to make ready our people for
the second comming of Christ, is the
spirit of <i>Ely</i> thinke wee sufficient for
us? What manner of persons ought we
to bee, burning in spirit, fervent in prayer,
thundring in preaching, shining in
life and conversation? Why is it then
my brethren (oh let my plainest rebukes
bee the fruits and signes of my
best love to mine owne Tribe; let
them not bee as breakings of the head,
but as precious balme to those
whose honour with the people, I preferre
to my life) why is it that some
of us pray so rarely and so coldly in
private (the evills of our times will
not out but by frequent fasting and
fervent prayer) in publique so briefly,
so perfunctorily, and feebly, that wee
scarce have any witnesses of what wee
say? Why are there yet remaining any
Mutes amongst us? Why are ther any
tounges that dare speake against often
or zealous preaching? Doth not <i>Paul
</i> adjure us before him that shall judge the
elect Angels, that we preach instantly,
in season, and out of season? Reade wee
the commentaries of that text, or let
the practise of Ancients expound it;
and tell mee if ever old or new interpreted
that charge, of bare reading, of
quarterly, or monethly, yea, or of once
on the Sabbath preaching onely, as if
that were fully sufficient, without endeavoring
or desiring any more. If
alwaies often preaching bee prating,
what meant the practise I say, not onely
of <i>Calvin</i>, and <i>Beza</i> but of <i>Chrysostome</i>,
<i>Basil</i>, <i>Ambrose</i> with other of the Fathers,
preaching every day in the weeke,
some of them twise in the weeke, none
of them so seldome, as such would bear
the world in hand. What meant sundry
ancient Councells, (the eleventh of <i>Tolet</i>
in Spaine) yea even of Trent it selfe,
to excite the torpor of the Bishoppes
of their times, as their Canons speake,
enjoyning frequent preaching, calling
for more then almost any man is able to
performe?</p>

<p>But heere I may turne reprooving
into rejoycing, that preaching
is growne in any better fashion and
grace with our times, by royall and
reverend, both examples and countenance:
only I wish that every <i>Archippus</i>
may fulfill his Ministery, be instant and
constant in preaching. <i>Salomon</i> the
older, and wiser hee grew, the more hee
taught the people, sharpened his goads,
and fastned his nails; whereas many
amongst us are so wise in their youth,
as to affect the foolishnes of preaching;
but in their dotage, Ease slayes the
foole; when the doore is oyled, it leaves
creaking; they must then fall to make
much of themselves, till contrary with
the Prophet they cry out, My fatnesse,
my fatnesse, my belly, my belly; so favouring
their lungs, that they will bee
sure never to die of <i>Davids</i> consumption
of zeale; let such preach, say they,
that want livings: and if for shame they
preach at all, it must bee rarely and easily,
for breaking of their winde (my
meaning is not to tax such, whom
God disinables by weaknesse of body;
or such as recompence their rarity
with industry, as <i>Perkins</i>, &amp;c.) and yet
forsooth these thinke they may justly
challenge, and weare the double honor
of countenance and maintenance; I
marvell with what right, or with what
face, so long as there remaineth expresse
Canon of Scripture, bequeathing it to
those, that toyle in word and doctrine.
Neither will zeale set us on worke onely
to preach, or to preach often to avoyd
the infamy of bare readers; but
it will teach us to preach painefully, and
that in the evidence and demonstration,
not so much of art, or nature,
as of the spirit and grace; regarding
onely, that the people know Christ and
him crucified; not caring whether they
know what wee have read, how many
quotations our memory will carry levell,
how roundly wee can utter our
minde in new minted words, in like
sounding, idle, vaine, and offensive <i>Paranomasies</i>;
I blush to fall into the least
touch of that kinde: yet at once to
shew and reproove that childish folly,
It is a vaine of vaine preaching, turning
sound preaching into a sound of preaching,
tickling mens eares, like a tinckling
cymball, feeding them, <span class="greek" title="[Greek: h&ecirc;dusmati kai ouk edesmasi]">
 &#951;&#948;&#965;&#963;&#956;&#945;&#964;&#953; &#954;&#945;&#953; &#959;&#965;&#954; &#949;&#948;&#949;&#963;&#956;&#945;&#963;&#953;</span>, spoyling the plaine song,
with descant and division: what is this
but to shew our owne levitie and want
of true Art; indeede affecting such a
dancing, piperly and effeminate eloquence
(as <i>Tully, Demosthenes</i>, or any
Masculine Oratour would scorne) in
steade of that divine powerfull deliverie,
which becommeth him, that speakes
the Oracles of God. If ever wee meane
to doe any good, wee must exhort and
reproove, with all vehemency and authority;
lifting upp our voyce as a
trumpet, as the sonnes of thunder;
pearcing their eares, witnessing, striving
and contending, according to our
gift whatsoever it bee, to manifest our
affections, that wee may worke upon
the people; which all the Art in the
world will not teach us to doe: onely
zeale at the heart will naturally produce
it, without straining or affecting.
If God require the heart as well as the
head; why should wee not labour to
moove the affections, as well as enforme
the judgement; There is a doctrinall, and
as some tearme it, a Doctorly kinde of
preaching, which is admired of some
that understand it not; of others that
could be content with the Masse againe,
because it was gentle, and had no teeth in
it. And such Sermons I have sometimes
heard, for matter voyd of exception,
but so delivered, as if one were acting
a part, or saying a lesson by heart.
It hath called to minde a song which
sometimes I have met withall, excellently
composed, full of sweet ayre,
surely and truely sung; but with flat
and dead voyces without spirit, which
hath marred the musique: Of such a
Sermon and Preacher, the Countreymans
verdict did well, that said, this man
may bee a great scholler, but hee wants
beetle and wedges to heaw our knotted
timber withall, our greene wood
will not burn unlesse it be better blown;
you shall sometimes see an excellent
horse of shape and colour, having many
of those markes <i>Du Bartes</i> describes
in <i>Caines</i> supposed horse; which yet
wanting mettle hath beene of little
worth, and lesse use. If there were no
other Preachers then these, which hold
themselves the onely profound and
learned Preachers, I muse what should
become of conversion of soules, which
they that covet; must come with the
spirit of <i>Elias</i>, to turne the hearts of
the fathers to their children, I may in
truth, and I hope with modesty speake
with the Preacher, that in observing I
have observed, and have found, that
divers great Clarkes have had but little
fruit of their ministery; but hardly
any truely zealous man of God (though
of lesser gifts) but have had much
comfort of their labours, in their owne
and bordering parishes, being in this
likened by <i>Gregorie</i>, to the yron on
the Smiths anvile sparkling round about.
And if for this any bordering
neighbours, whose cold labours worke
not the like successe, shall accuse them
of some kinde (I know not what) of policie
in bewitching the people; they
may well reply, Behold our zealous affections
are our charmes, and zeale all
our witchcraft, as <i>Latimer</i> well answered
one that accused the people of partiality,
for not affecting him that preached
one of his printed Sermons, that
hee had indeede his Sticke, but wanted
his Rosen; meaning his zealous manner
of preaching and living, without which
last, all the former will doe but little
good, if a good ensample of life accompany
not their doctrine, as lightning
doth thunder. For there are some
(I speake with sorrow of heart) that
seeme to have fire in their preaching, but
carry water in their life; being notoriously
proud, covetous, or debauched, stained
with odious vices. Let us heare
the summ of all. Doe wee love Christ
more then ordinary? would wee give
proofe of our trebble love to him? Let
us then feede his flocke with a trebble
zeale, expressed in our prayer, preaching
and living: Let us make it appeare
to the consciences of all, that the top of
our ambition is Gods glory: and that
wee preferr the winning of soules, to the
winning of the world.</p>

<p>This title of Angels why may it not
also be extended to Magistrates, as well
as that higher stile, of Gods; Sure I am,
that the scarlet robe of zeale would exceeding
well become them. <i>Jethro</i> maketh
it their prime and essentiall character;
God and <i>Moses</i>, their onely and
sole, in the charge and commission to
<i>Jehoshuah</i> so oft repeated; <i>Onely be of good
courage</i>. And if <i>David</i> were now to re-pen
his Psalme; I thinke hee might alter
the forme of his counsell, and say,
<i>Bee zealous yee Rulers and Judges of the
world</i>, and not wise and politique: or rather
under the tearmes of wisdome, hee
comprehends indeede the zeale wee call
for, the most now adayes being <i>Gallio's</i>,
wise onely for the matters of the Commonwealth;
not having a sparke of
that spirit which was in <i>Phineas, Daniel</i>,
and <i>Nehemias</i>, &amp;c. for the Lord of
hosts, or to his Lawes and Commandements;
as if God had made Magistrates
keepers onely of the second Table, governours
of men, and not of Christians;
guardians onely of civill societies, and
not of his Church, and shepheards also
of his flocke. Are Idolatries, blasphemies,
prophaning of Saboths, no sinns?
Why then either have not the lawes
force and strength enough in them (as
sometime wee are answered when wee
complaine) or why are they not executed
for the suppressing of these raging
sins? are not all they punished with death
in the Scriptures, as well as breaches of
the second table? Blood I leave to the
malignant Church, and admire clemency
in Rulers, as much as any; but yet I
know the prophane dissolutenesse of the
times, requires a three stringed whipp
of severity to purge our <i>Augean</i> stable
of the soule abuses, whipt often with
penns and tongues, but spared by
them that beare the sword (a man may
say of many Governours) altogether in
vaine for matters of religion. Are not
kings of the earth charg'd to render double
to the bloody strumpet of Rome?
Why then doth the hurtfull pitty of
our times imbolden and increase their
numbers? <i>Laodicea</i> it selfe, I doubt not,
for matters of mine and thine, had (as
their name imports) good civill justice
and justicers; but what was God the
neerer for it? doth hee not threaten for
all that to spue them out of his mouth?
shall hee not curse those that doe his
worke negligently, fearfully &amp; partially?
Our times complaine of two speciall
canker wormes of justice, which eat up
zeale in Magistrates. The first is <i>Covetousnesse</i>,
which makes men of place to
transgresse for a morsell of bread; the
zeale of their owne houses consumes
the zeale of Gods house: The building
of great houses, keeping of great houses,
and matching with great houses, raising
and leaving of great houses behinde
them, makes them so ravenous, that
they devoure so much, as choakes all
their zeale; which would teach them
to shake their laps of bribes, and scorne
to accept gifts, though men would augment
them for the perverting of judgement.
The other is <i>Cowardice</i> and <i>Fearfulnes</i>:
which how unfit, and base a quality
did <i>Nehemiah</i> thinke it for a man of
his place? no better then shynesse in a
fore-horse, whose eyes men fence on
both sides, that they may lead the way,
and goe without starting; unto which,
zeale is answerable in Magistrates, causing
them onely to see him that is invisible,
without casting a squint eye at
men; to sing to God onely of judgement
and mercy, without tuning their
songs to mans eare; to walke in the perfect way,
without turning, either to the
right or left hand for feare of favour. Oh
that there were such an heart in our leaders;
how easily would our people follow!
what a spring tide of zeale should
wee have, if the Sunne and Moone
would cast out a benigne aspect upon
them! Doth it not flourish in all those
shires and townes, where the Word and
Sword doe joyntly cherish it? In others
which are the greatest number, how
doth it languish and wane away, and
hang downe the head? where is it in diverse
places of the land to bee seene? I
had almost sayd in my haste and heat,
there is none that hath zeale, no not
one, there is no courage for the truth;
but that I remember that <i>Eliah</i> was
checked for over-shooting himselfe in
his too short and quicke computation.
I hope the Lord hath his fifties amongst
us, though but thinn sowne in
comparison of the swarmes of professed
Recusants, and Church-Papists, of
prophane Atheists, key-cold worldlings,
and lukewarme professors. The bodies
of our many severall Congregations,
yea even of the better sort, whereunto
have they beene likened by our separated
adversaries; but unto the Prophet
<i>Hosea</i> his cake, halfe baked upon the
hearth, having one side, that is, the one
side to the world-ward, in publique service,
scorched a little and browned over;
but the inside to God-ward, in private,
and family-duties, no better then
dough; many of them making indeede
some shew, as the out-landish fruits
that are plashed upon our walls, but
wanting heat never come to maturity.
If wee should make good their resemblances,
how then should wee please the
stomacke of God? who hath indeede
brooked and borne us a long time, I
doubt but wamblingly. How neare
were wee going in 88. and in the powder
treason? Doe we thinke he will ever
digest us, in the temper wee are in?
which (to confesse the truth of the fashionable
Christian) what is it but a
state of neutrality, indifferency, or such
a mediocrity, as will just serve the time,
satisfie Law, or stand with reputation
of neighbours? beyond which, if any
step a little forward, do not the rest hunt
upon the stop? If there hap to breake
out a sparkle of zeale in any one house
in a parish; is not the whole towne in
an uprore, as when the bells ring awke
every man brings his bucket, to the
quenching of this fire? If hell bee in an
Ale-house, who cryes out of it? &amp; as for
our Sundayes Church-service, which is
all that God gets at our hands; how
perfunctorily, and fashionably is it slubbered
over; how are his Saboths made
the voyder and dung-hill for all refuse
businesse, divided betweene the Church
and the Ale-house, the May-pole commonly
beguiling the Pulpit? What man
would not spue to see God thus worshipped?
This want of devotion makes
the foule mouthed Papists to spet at us:
this want of reformation, makes the
queasie-stomacked Brownists cast themselves
out of the Church; and shall God
alwayes suffer the land to beare us? But
behold, he stands at the door &amp; knocks,
by treasons, by plagues, by the hammer
of dearths, discontents, fires, inundations,
especially by the word; his locks are
wet with waiting. Oh before hee shake
off the dust of his feet against us, and
turne to some other nation more worthy,
let us open the doore, that hee may
come in and sup with us; if hee love us,
hee will purge us, and scoure us, by one
chastizement or other: if hee have no
pleasure in us, hee cannot but unburthen
his stomacke of us; If all the land besides
should turne the deafe eare, yet let
mee entreat and charge you of my flock
to heare his voyce, &amp; be zealous. Since
my comming amongst you, I have handled
some bookes of the olde Testament,
the Epistles to the Romanes, to the Hebrewes,
of Saint <i>James</i>, <i>Peter</i> and <i>John</i>,
out of them taught the doctrine of the
Law, of Faith, Love and good Workes:
now in the choyce of this Epistle of
Christ to <i>Laodicea</i>, my desire was to
boyle up the former to their just temper:
in which worke I can willingly bee content
to spend my strength, and dayes, if
God see it fit. I cannot be a better sacrifice
then to God, and for you, if I waste
my selfe, so you may have light &amp; heat;
what else is the end of my life? God hath
given you a name, your zeale is gone abroad,
&amp; I hope you have many names
among you; the Lord encrease their number
and zeale. If but one of us this day,
shall open this doore of his heart with
<i>Jehoshuah</i>, let others chuse, I and my
house will serve the Lord more zealously
then heeretofore; neither I nor hee
shall have lost our labours. A lively picture
casts the eye upon every one that
comes neere it: such is the word with
whom, and with which we have to do;
Let him that is now colde, grow colder
&amp; colder; but let him that hath an eare,
heare what hath beene sayd to the Churches;
and be zealous and amend.</p>

<p>The Lord give us not onely understanding,
but zeale in all things: he baptize
us with fire: hee breath on us, and
inspire into us the spirit of life &amp; power,
&amp;c. So shall wee runn the wayes of his
commandements.</p>

1.F.1.  Project Gutenberg volunteers and employees expend considerable
effort to identify, do copyright research on, transcribe and proofread
public domain works in creating the Project Gutenberg-tm
collection.  Despite these efforts, Project Gutenberg-tm electronic
works, and the medium on which they may be stored, may contain
"Defects," such as, but not limited to, incomplete, inaccurate or
corrupt data, transcription errors, a copyright or other intellectual
property infringement, a defective or damaged disk or other medium, a
computer virus, or computer codes that damage or cannot be read by
your equipment.

of Replacement or Refund" described in paragraph 1.F.3, the Project

is also defective, you may demand a refund in writing without further
opportunities to fix the problem.

law of the state applicable to this agreement, the agreement shall be

or cause to occur: (a) distribution of this or any Project Gutenberg-tm
work, (b) alteration, modification, or additions or deletions to any
Project Gutenberg-tm work, and (c) any Defect you cause.


Section  2.  Information about the Mission of Project Gutenberg-tm

Project Gutenberg-tm is synonymous with the free distribution of
electronic works in formats readable by the widest variety of computers
including obsolete, old, middle-aged and new computers.  It exists
because of the efforts of hundreds of volunteers and donations from
people in all walks of life.

Volunteers and financial support to provide volunteers with the
assistance they need, is critical to reaching Project Gutenberg-tm's
goals and ensuring that the Project Gutenberg-tm collection will
remain freely available for generations to come.  In 2001, the Project
Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation was created to provide a secure
and permanent future for Project Gutenberg-tm and future generations.

Section 4.  Information about Donations to the Project Gutenberg
Literary Archive Foundation

Project Gutenberg-tm depends upon and cannot survive without wide
spread public support and donations to carry out its mission of
increasing the number of public domain and licensed works that can be
freely distributed in machine readable form accessible by the widest
array of equipment including outdated equipment.  Many small donations
($1 to $5,000) are particularly important to maintaining tax exempt
status with the IRS.

The Foundation is committed to complying with the laws regulating
charities and charitable donations in all 50 states of the United
States.  Compliance requirements are not uniform and it takes a
considerable effort, much paperwork and many fees to meet and keep up
with these requirements.  We do not solicit donations in locations
where we have not received written confirmation of compliance.  To
SEND DONATIONS or determine the status of compliance for any
particular state visit http://pglaf.org

While we cannot and do not solicit contributions from states where we
have not met the solicitation requirements, we know of no prohibition
against accepting unsolicited donations from donors in such states who
approach us with offers to donate.

International donations are gratefully accepted, but we cannot make
any statements concerning tax treatment of donations received from
outside the United States.  U.S. laws alone swamp our small staff.

Please check the Project Gutenberg Web pages for current donation
methods and addresses.  Donations are accepted in a number of other
ways including including checks, online payments and credit card
donations.  To donate, please visit: http://pglaf.org/donate


Section 5.  General Information About Project Gutenberg-tm electronic
works.

Professor Michael S. Hart is the originator of the Project Gutenberg-tm
concept of a library of electronic works that could be freely shared
with anyone.  For thirty years, he produced and distributed Project
Gutenberg-tm eBooks with only a loose network of volunteer support.

Project Gutenberg-tm eBooks are often created from several printed
editions, all of which are confirmed as Public Domain in the U.S.
unless a copyright notice is included.  Thus, we do not necessarily
keep eBooks in compliance with any particular paper edition.

Most people start at our Web site which has the main PG search facility:

     http://www.gutenberg.net

This Web site includes information about Project Gutenberg-tm,
including how to make donations to the Project Gutenberg Literary
Archive Foundation, how to help produce our new eBooks, and how to
subscribe to our email newsletter to hear about new eBooks.
